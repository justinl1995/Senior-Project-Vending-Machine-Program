# Senior-Project-Vending-Machine-Program
Smart Vending Suite was an idea that our group came up with. The system uses phpmyadmin and wampserver to help bring the project to life. Using PHP and SQL, we were able to get all of the features built and ready for the final presentation.
For the project I used phpmyadmin to setup the database connection. Also to get a connection to the database through my browser I used WAMPServer.

.php files are the actual files that the system runs on. The pictures are used for the vending machine .php file and can be ignored. The FinalStuff.sql is all of the database
tables for the system itself. It does include some of the test items for the system.


To install the system onto a WAMPserver:
1. Download Wampserver
2. Run Wampserver
3. Go to File->(Drive you put Wampserver on)->Wamp->www
4. Copy and paste all of the files from the project folder into the WWW folder.

To access the files in the WWW folder:
1. Open any browser
2. Make sure that the wampserver icon is green in the toolbar.
3. type localhost/(project file) [EX: localhost/index.php]

To install the database file into phpmyadmin through wampserver:
1. Open any browser
2. Make sure the wampserver icon is green in the toolbar.
3. Type localhost
4. Select phpmyadmin in the menu
5. Select import
6. Attach finalstuff.sql
7. Run
